React Hacker News
===
This repo is a updated version from [HN front page in React](https://mking.github.io/react-hn).

As we know, the latest version of react is [0.14.3](https://facebook.github.io/react/downloads.html). And you need use react.js and react-dom.js to develop your app. "React.render" is also needs to be replaced by "ReactDOM.render".

I have upgraded the version of th react and corrected the usecase in javascript file.
